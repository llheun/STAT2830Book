\chapter{Dataset Descriptive Information}
\label{chap:ch2}

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Explain the purpose of descriptive statistics in making data comprehensible.
%\item Compute and interpret percentages, proportions, ratios, rates, and percentage change.
%\item Construct and analyze frequency distributions for variables at each of the three levels of measurement.
\item Summarize and analyze data using graphical methods.
\end{itemize}

The data from a research project cannot articulate by itself.  As social scientists, we must compute  descriptive statistics so that we can quickly understand the results of the project.  We as researchers use data science (statistics) to elucidate the results.  In this chapter, we will consider graphics, percentages, rates, and tables.  While these single value descriptive statistics are not rigorous, but are very useful for giving project results without doubt. 


\section{Descriptive Statistics for Categorical Data}

{\bf{Percents, proportions, rates, and ratio}} are the primary statistics for categorical data and are used for either nominal or ordinal data.

\subsection{Percentages and Proportions}

A sample of various court sentencing results were collected and the results are displayed in the summary table below.  Compute the proportion and percent of sentenced acquitted.

\begin{align*}

	percent_A    &= \frac{10}{269} \times 100 = 3.72\%   \\
\end{align*}

The following describe the general form of the equation for proportions and percentages.

\begin{eqnarray}
	proportion   &=& \frac{f}{n}   \\ 
	percent  &=& \frac{f}{n} \times 100\%  
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{itemize}
\item where \emph{f} is the number of cases in a category
and \emph{n} is the number of cases in all categories.
\end{itemize}

To summarize:

\begin{itemize} 
\item Proportions are numbers that are always between zero and one.
\item To convert  a proportion to a percent,  multiply it  by 100.
\item To convert a percent to a proportion, divide it by 100.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{GSS Example}
The General Social Survey (GSS), conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, is a major source of data on social attitudes in the U.S.  Once each year, 1500 adults are interviewed in their homes all across the country.  The subjects are  asked their opinions about sex and marriage, attitudes toward women, welfare, foreign policy, and many other issues.  After reviewing this data from the GSS (See Table: 2.2), compute the proportion and percent of persons who indicate that voting is a very important responsibility of being a female citizen.

   \caption{Frequency Distribution of Voting}
   \label{tab:t2_2}
\end{table} 

\begin{align*} 
	proportion_F &= \frac{366}{574} = 0.6376  \\
	percent_F    &= \frac{366}{574} \times 100 = 63.76\% 
\end{align*}	


\subsubsection{Interpretation}
 The percent  of women who indicate that voting is a very important responsibility of a citizen is 63.76 percent.
 
 
\subsection{Ratio}

The \emph{ratio} is relation between two similar magnitudes in respect to the number of times the first contains the second.

Let's consider a STAT 2830  class of 25 females and 20 males, compute the following: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item  The ratio of females to males: 

\begin{equation}
Ratio = \frac{f_1}{f_2} = \frac{f_{females}}{f_{males}} = \frac{25}{20} = \frac{5}{4}
\end{equation}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This means that there are five females for every four  males in the class.
  \end{itemize}

\item   The ratio of male to females:

\begin{equation}
Ratio = \frac{f_1}{f_2} = \frac{f_{males}}{f_{females}} = \frac{20}{25} = \frac{4}{5}
\end{equation}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item This means that there are four males for every five females in the class.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


{\bf{Why  social scientists use ratios?}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Ratios are useful for comparing the relative size of different categories of a variable.

\begin{equation}
Ratio = \frac{f_1}{f_2}, 
\end{equation}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item where $f_1$ is the number of cases in the first category and $f_2$ is the number of cases in the second category.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{GSS Example}

After reviewing the data from the GSS (See Table 2.2), compute the ratio  of males to females who indicate that voting is a very important responsibility of being a citizen.

\begin{equation}
Ratio = \frac{f_1}{f_2} = \frac{f_{males}}{f_{females}} = \frac{437}{366}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Interpretation}

This means that there are 437 males for every 366 females who indicated that voting is a very important responsibility of being a citizen.

\subsection{Rates}

Suppose a town of 85,000 residents  had 10 homicides last year, what is the homicide rate per (100,000) in this town.

\begin{itemize}
\item Homicide rate is the number of deaths divided by the population size.

\begin{equation}
homicideRate = \frac{f}{n} = \frac{10}{85000} = 0.0001176
\end{equation}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Because this is  a small fraction, it is reported as the homicide rate per 100,000 individuals, or 
  \end{itemize}

\begin{equation}
homicideRatePer100000  = \frac{10}{85000} \times 100,000 = 11.76,
\end{equation}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item which is read as 11.76 homicides per 100.000 population.  This is a convenient comparison statistic between groups of widely differing populations.
  \end{itemize}

\item Rates are used when the proportion of occurrences are small to obtain a measure that can be used to compare measures with different population sizes.

\item Rates are usually multiplied by some power of 10 to eliminate decimal points.

\begin{equation}
Rate = \frac{f}{n} \times (per) , 
\end{equation}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item where \emph{f} is the number of occurrences, \emph{n} is the total possible occurences, and \emph{per} is the multiplier for the rate.
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}



\subsection{Percent Change}

Suppose in just a year 2000, a ??? state had a homicide rate of 6.5 and in 2010 had a homicide rate of 9.2 (reported as homicides per 100,000 population).  

\begin{itemize}
\item What is the percentage change?
\begin{eqnarray}
PercentChange & = & \frac{f_2 - f_1}{f_1} \times 100\%  \nonumber \\
                          & = & \frac{9.2 - 6.5}{6.5} \times 100\%  \nonumber \\
                          & = & \frac{2.7}{6.5} \times 100\%  = 41.5\%  \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
                          
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Notice that 6.5 is used as $f_1$ since this the the earlier time (2000 versus 2010).  This results in a 41.5 percent increase in the homicide rate.  This is consistent with the reported rates since 9.2 is an increase over 6.5.
  \end{itemize}
  

\item The percent change measures social change.  It is telling us
 how a variable has increased (positive rate) or decreased (negative rate) over a certain span of time.

\begin{equation}
PercentChange = \frac{f_2 - f_1}{f_1} \times 100\% ,
\end{equation}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item where $f_1$ is the first frequency (starting point) and $f_2$ is the second frequency (ending point).  The results express the size (and direction) of the change in scores $(f_2 - f_1)$ as a percentage to the score at the earlier time $(f_1)$.
  
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Frequency Distribution Table}

The GSS 2014 is a sociological survey used to collect data on demographic characteristics and attitudes of residents of the United States. The survey is conducted face-to-face with an in-person interview by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, of adults (18+) in randomly selected households.  An example of a survey question is about the years of educaton of the household.  The data, from this survey, show the maximum years of education of the household.  A frequency distribution  provides an accurate picture of the overall years of educaton structure.

\begin{itemize}
\item Determine number of classes, minimum, maximum, range and interval size.
\item \# of classes: generally, we take the square root of the sample size, $\sqrt{2538} = 50.4$, but in this case, this value exceeds 10 which is the maximum number of suggested bars.
\item $minimum = 0$
\item $maximum = 20$
\item $range = 20 - 0 $
\item $intervalSize = \frac{range}{\# of Classes} = \frac{20}{10} = 2 $

\begin{itemize}
\item The bars represent the categories and the heights of the bars correspond to the percentage or number of cases in each category.

\item Histograms have areas that are proportional to the frequency; i.e., in Table 2.7, we see that the frequency for the sub-group 10-12 years is 823 of 2538 or 32.4 percent.  In this text, we will set the bars to the same width. 

\item Histograms sometimes use percentages instead of counts to make it possible to compare distributions of differing sample sizes.

\item Histograms are very useful in examing the ``shape'' of the distribution, for example: Bell-shaped and symmetrical.  Skewed (left or right),   Multi-modal.
