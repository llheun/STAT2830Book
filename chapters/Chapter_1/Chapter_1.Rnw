\end{itemize}     
     
\section{Introduction}     
\subsection{Reasons to Study Data Science}
\subsubsection{Conduct Research}

The first reason is to administer a  research projects. Without  statistics you will have a tough time making decisions based on the data that you collected for your research project. Statistics provides you with  tools to make an informed decision. You will be able to decide which of the possibilities is more likely to be true. You will base this decision on your knowledge of  inferential statistics. 

\subsubsection{Study Design}

The second reason to study statistics is that you will be equipped to read scientific journals. Most technical journals that you will read contain some form of statistics. Usually, you will find them in the results section of the report. If you are not familiar with statistics, the information contained in this section will be meaningless.  An understanding of introductory statistics will provide you with the fundamental skills necessary to read and evaluate most results sections. The ability to extract meaning from journal articles and the ability to critically evaluate research from a statistical perspective are fundamental skills that will enhance your knowledge and understanding in related programs of study. 

\subsubsection{Develop Critical Thinking Skills}

The third reason is to further develop critical and analytic thinking skills.  After completing high school and introductory undergraduate coursework, you will have at your disposal a variety of critical thinking and analytic skills. The study of statistics will serve to enhance and further develop these skills. By doing well in statistics, you will develop and use formal logical thinking abilities that are both high level and creative. 

\subsubsection{Be an Informed Consumer}

The fourth reason to study statistics is to be an informed consumer. Like any other tool, statistics can be used or abused.  Yes, it is true that some individuals do actively lie and mislead with statistics. More often, however, well meaning individuals unintentionally report erroneous statistical conclusions. If you know some of the basic statistical concepts, you will be in a better position to evaluate the information that you have been given. 

\subsubsection{Know When to Hire a Statistician}

The fifth reason to have a working knowledge of statistics is to know when you need  help from a statistician.  Most of us know enough about our cars to know when to take it into the shop.  Usually, we do not attempt the repair ourselves because we do not want to cause any irreparable damage.  Also, we try to know enough to speak intelligibly with service center employee to insure that we do not get 
a whole new motor (big bucks) when all we need is a new fuel filter (a few bucks).
We should use the same logic when 
employing a statistician.  Doing research is expensive in terms of resources and time.  It does not make sense to risk an entire project by attempting to  analyze the data  yourself with widely available statistical software.  
It is very easy to analyze data that is either  
inappropriate or incomplete  because we had not used the services of a competent statistian.
As with the service center employee discussed above, it is also important to have enough statistical knowledge to discuss your project and the data analyses you want computed with the statistician you hire. In other words, you want to be able to make sure that your statistician is on the right track. 

\subsubsection{To summarize}

The five reasons to study statistics: 
\begin{itemize}
\item to be able to effectively conduct research, 
\item to be able to read and evaluate journal articles, 
\item to further develop critical thinking and analytic skills, 
\item to act a an informed consumer, and 
\item to know when you need to hire outside statistical help. % \cite{URL}{knoko}

\subsubsection{The Scientific Process, The Wheel of Science}

The Wheel of Science gives us  a process to refine our thinking about the nature of social interactions.  See Figure 1.1.  The wheel has four parts that will be defined below:  Theory, Hypotheses, Observations, and Empirical Generalizations.

   \label{fig:WS}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{{Research}} Research  is the systematic inquiry into the study of situations to establish facts and reach new conclusion.

\subsubsection{{Data science}}  Data science is the systemic study of structure and behavior of collecting, organizing, evaluating, and interpreting data.  The interpretation phase refers population characteristics from sampling.

\subsubsection{{Data}} Data are information collected from the population for further analysis.

\subsubsection{Theory}  Theory is a statement used to explain a situation, eg., 
is there a difference about alcohol awareness  between health and safety class and a statistics class among college stadents.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis}  Hypothesis is an explanation about an association between events, eg.,  
alcohol awareness among college students is the same between  students enrolled in a health and safety class and for those enrolled in a statistics class.

\subsubsection{Observations}  Observations are collected data to test hypothesis, eg., a random sample of students enrolled in a health and safety class and those enrolled in a statistics class which surveys alcohol awareness.



\subsubsection{Empirical Generalizations}  Empirical generalizations are made to assess the theory after analyzing the data, eg., 
A study of alcohol awareness among college students reported a higher awareness for students enrolled in a health and safety class than for those enrolled in a statistics class.

\subsubsection{Variables and Cases}

\subsubsection{Variables}

\begin{itemize}
\item Variables are attributes of a person (case).
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Examples: socio-economic stats such as age, gender, race, and social class.
  \end{itemize}

\item Theories and hypotheses are asserting the association between variables.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A theory may identify some variables as causes (independent variables) and others as effects or results (dependent variable).
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Case}

\begin{itemize}
\item Case is a collection of variables from a person (entity).
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Cases are from groups; for example, members from churches or unions or cities or states.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example}

Describe  the color of eyes of students in this class.

\begin{itemize}
\item Variable is color of eyes of students
\item Data is color such as black, blue, brown, green, hazel.
\item Cases are students from this class.
\item Appropriate analysis include:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item frequency (number) of students who have brown eyes.
	\item percent of students who have blue eyes.
	\item bar chart showing the percentage of each color of eyes.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}	
     
\section{Types of Statistics}


\subsection{Descriptive Statistics}

Descriptive statistics are used to explain the basic features of the data in a study.

There are three methods of describing data.

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf{Univariate}} descriptive statistics -- summarizes {\bf{one variable at a time}}, such as 
numerical, graphical,  % averages, percentages, charts and graphs:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The average IQ of the class is 120,  also range, variance, etc. 
	\item The percent of females taking Stat 2830 this semester is 55 percent.
	\end{itemize}

\item {\bf{Bivariate}} descriptive statistics -- summarizes {\bf{two variables at a time}}, such as 
looking for relationships between two variables that describe strength and direction.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The relationship between college juniors and seniors credit card debt is  positive and strong.
	
	\end{itemize}	

\item {\bf{Multivariate}} descriptive statistics -- summarizes {\bf{three or more variables at a time}}, such as 
looking for relationships between three or more variables that describe strength and direction.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item It has been alleged that obvious consumption is a way for men to show their status to other males.  
	A recent study looked at the changes in testosterone level in response to changes in his status created by 
	using a product such as an old car versus a new sports car.  The subjects of the study were told to drive 
	on a busy urban avenue or on a less traveled rural highway.

	\end{itemize}	
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Inferential Statistics}

Inferential statistics makes a general statement about a population based on a sample se;ected from that population.

\setlength{\unitlength}{1cm}
\begin{picture}(8,4)
\put(2,2){\circle{1}}
\put(5,2){\circle{0.6}}
\put(3,2){\vector(4,0){1}}
\put(1.9,1.9){{\bf{P}}}
\put(4.9,1.9){{\bf{S}}}
\end{picture}

\begin{itemize}
\item Population (P) contains all cases.  Usually, it is very large which makes a complete enumeration of all values nearly impossible because of budget, or other limitations.
\item Samples (S) are part of the population,  while a sample represents a part of the population it has a manageable size.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Inferential Statistics Example}

Since 1968, voter surveys use inferential statistics.

\begin{itemize}
\item A random sample of voters are polled about their voting preferences.
\item The results are used to estimate the voting preferences of all voters.
\item e.g., The Democrat candidate will receive about 48 percent of the vote in Kalamazoo County.
\end{itemize}

\section{Types of Data}
\subsection{Categorical (qualitative data)}

\begin{itemize}
\item characteristics CANNOT be measured.
\item e.g., gender, eye color, race, political affiliation, social status, etc.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Levels of Measurement for Categorical Data}

\begin{itemize}
\item Nominal categorical variable has no order:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item e.g., The scores are labels and ordering does not exist.
	\item e.g., gender, SSN, the names of food pantries in Kalamazoo County.
	\end{itemize} 
\item Ordinal categorical variable has order:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item e.g., The scores can be ranked and ordering does exist.
	\item e.g., The management structure of at city hall (mayor, department heads, etc.), class levels (freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior), social-economic status (poor, middle class, and rich).
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
		

\subsection{Numerical (quantitative data)}

\begin{itemize}
\item characteristics CAN be measured.
\item e.g., age, height, weight, number of students in this class, etc.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Levels of Measurement for Numerical Data}

\begin{itemize}

\item A ratio numerical variable has a meaningful zero value, a proportion is allowed, and has magnitude.
	
		\begin{itemize}
		\item {\bf{Discrete}}
		\item result of a counting process (whole number values)
		\item results of question ``how many?''
		\item e.g., number of children per family.
		
		\item {\bf{Continuous}}
		
		\item has scores that can be subdivided infinitely (at least theoretically)
		\item e.g., age, time, distance to school.
		\end{itemize}

\item An interval numerical  variable has magnitude but the ratio does not make sense.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item e.g., GPA (using a 4 point system, a 4 is not twice the value of a 2),  temperature (60 degrees is not twice as warm as 30 degrees).
	  
	\end{itemize} 	
	
\end{itemize}
