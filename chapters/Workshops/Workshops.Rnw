      You want to know the opinions of American school teachers about establishing a national test for high school graduation.  You obtain a list of the members of the National Education Association (the largest teachers' union) and mail a questionnaire to 2500 teachers chosen at random from this list.  In all 1,347 teachers return the questionnaire.  The sample is

    A paint manufacturer fills cans of paint using a machine that has been calibrated to fill the cans to contain an average of 128 ounces each.  To test whether their machine has come out of calibration, the manufacturer takes a random sample of 25 cans and finds that they average 129.3 ounces with a standard deviation of 2.8 ounces.  Is this strong evidence that the filling machine is set too high and thus is no longer calibrated properly? (Use significance level 0.05)

      A study of child development measures the age (months) at which a child begins to talk and also the child's score on an ability test given several years later.  the study asks whether the age at which a child talks helps that later test score.  The least-squares regression line of the test score $y$ on age $x$ is $y = 110 - 1.3x$.  According to this regression line, what happens (on the average) when a child starts talking one month later?

      Lean body mass (your weight leaving out fat) helps predict metabolic rate (how many calories of energy you burn in an hour).  The relationship is roughly a straight line.  The least-squares regression line for predicting metabolic rate (y in calories) from lean body mass (x in kilograms) is $y = 113.2 + 26.9x$.  
      
      Using this regression line, you predict that a person with lean body mass 50 kilograms will have metabolic rate equal to about how many calories?
